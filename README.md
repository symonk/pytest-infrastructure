## What is pytest-validate? :flags:
Pytest-validate is a plugin for pytest that given a python module containing a list of adhering validate functions will
ensure the stack under test or runtime environment is as you expect before wasting time running test(s).  How it works is
outlined below

pytest-validate Goals:
 - Quickly validate a test environment or general runtime environment against X functions
 - Create an easy way for user-defined functions to be loaded and evaluated at runtime
 - When failure(s) occur provide powerful means of configuration and sensible error messages

#### Important Notes:
 - pytest-validate does **not!** support python version(s) earlier than 3.7 officially
 - pytest-validate is open to pull requests that bring in backwards compatability but it is not a priority now
